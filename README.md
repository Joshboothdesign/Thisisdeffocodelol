## Josh's Read Me

This code created in *2004 in a tragic market town called **Pontefract** but has to tell everyone near Leeds because no one knows where **Pontefract**.*

This code usually runs off of less than 6 hours sleep and spends excessive amounts of time in front of his computer screen.

**Error** This code is really bad at organising his files so expect a really full SSD with no clue as to where the space is being taken up from, with about 30 autosaves from each After Effects project that he cannot be bothered deleting.

**This code will usually crash at 2am**

This code will also listen to the same set of songs on repeat for a month or two until he eventually gets bored of it and never listens to it again until around 3 months later where the code repeats.

Thank you for reading this read me file.
